How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I do my best to keep functions simple, performing a single action which can be used and reused in different applications. I also try to adhere to standards and practices when it comes to naming conventions and overall format.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

So much of this course has been learning about the subject matter that I do not really believe I had an approach. I simply did my best to follow the directions and to check every box when it came to the assignment criteria.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In relation to this project, my goal was to take information stored in a database and to make it easy to access, edit, filter, and review in a variety of different formats (tables and graphs). An overabundance of information was wrangled into a helpful usable tool.
